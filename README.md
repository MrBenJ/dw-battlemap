Dungeon World Battlemap
=======================

## About

My friends and I are having a difficult time visualizing the battles in our tabletop game, so I made this handly webapp to help us visualize battles in Dungeon World.

## Prerequisites

* A modern browser (Chrome preferred!)
* Node v8+

## Installation

* Clone repo with `git clone`
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Run `npm start` to run the app

**Note**: This was boilerplated by the wonderful [Webapp Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) from Yeoman.

## Deploying

* Build the app with `npm run build`
* Serve assets in the `/dist` folder

Enjoy!
